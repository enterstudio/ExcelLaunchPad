{"name":"Excel Launchpad","tagline":"Open Excel compatible files in a new instance of Excel","body":"# Excel LaunchPad\r\nNow free and open source! :boom: :tada:\r\n\r\n## What is it?\r\nExcel LaunchPad adds a right-click menu option to Excel-compatibile files which opens the file in its own instance of Excel. That's it.  \r\n\r\n## That's it? Why would I want that?\r\nBefore Excel 2013, the default behavior was to reuse running Excel instances whenever a new Excel file was opened. But sometimes that's not what you want. Sometimes, you want to open files in a *new* instance of Excel. There are workarounds, of course; you can manually launch a new instance of Excel and then open the desired file. But it's just easier to right-click the file, select `Open in new window`, and be done with it.\r\n\r\nHowever! As of Excel 2013, the default behavior has been changed such that all Excel files are opened in their own instances of Excel - just like Word has done, pretty much forever. So if you're using Excel 2013 or later, Excel LaunchPad is *not* for you. :-)\r\n\r\n## How do I get it?\r\nComing soon!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
